Ollie_Ollie_TechDeck (_HaHaHyena), "Foda-se" (Devon), and JunkDrives0 would like to give thanks to everyone who gave this hack a chance during the 2024 hacking contest. It was really cool to see people's reactions to it, and even seeing some getting engaged with it. It was a fun ride, and we hope to develop more projects (as ourselves, not as Ollie). I hope you enjoy this release of the source code.
