# GameTap, Cup Noodles, and Bitter Tears

***GameTap, Cup Noodles, and Bitter Tears*** is a follow up to 2019's GameTap Pro Gamer 6, developed by Steazy Games. Based off of Knuckles' Chaotix and Sonic 3 and Knuckles, this hack features RPG elements, nods to early 2010's creepypasta culture, and a loose retelling of Ollie_Ollie_TechDeck's life story leading up to this hack.

**Warning:** This hack contains blood, gore, and themes of depression.

## Note

Towards the end of development, we were beginning to crunch. As such, there will be chunks of code that are outright sloppy (particularly in regards to RPG mode cutscenes and NPC movement). Keep that in mind if you choose to look through the code.
