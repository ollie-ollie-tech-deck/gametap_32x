# GameTap, Cup Noodles, and Bitter Tears

***GameTap, Cup Noodles, and Bitter Tears*** is a follow up to 2019's GameTap Pro Gamer 6, developed by Steazy Games. Based off of Knuckles' Chaotix and Sonic 3 and Knuckles, this hack features RPG elements, nods to early 2010's creepypasta culture, and a loose retelling of Ollie_Ollie_TechDeck's life story leading up to this hack.

**Warning:** This hack contains blood, gore, and themes of depression.
